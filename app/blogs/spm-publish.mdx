This guide is going to be a bit more complicated as it is going to deploy a compiled binary framework from a private repository to a public repository using CI/CD.

Here is the scheme of what we are going to do:

![Release Schema](/assets/blog3schema.svg)

As we can see the process doesn't look that complicated except one single tiny thing that we need to do. We need to synchronies 2 repos so when a `git tag` is created from the private repo where the code is located the public repo gets a new github release and updated `Package.swift` file with a fresh checksum and url.

On the private repo a new `git tag` will trigger the code to get tested & compiled into a `XCFramework`. When we have the `XCFramework` we are going to then get its checksum (`SHA256`) and update the public repos `Package.swift` with the checksum but there is an issue here we also need to provide a public url of where the new `XCFramework` has been hosted. To solve this we are going to leverage Github's release and artifacts and upload the `XCFramework` there + we can use this for users that want to download the standalone framework and integrate it manually into there project.

Alright this sounds nice but there is again an even tinier problem here. The problem is that we need to first update the `Package.swift` and create a commit on the public repo which is pushed to the main branch and then we can actual create the release and upload the `XCFramework`. If we do this the other way around which would have been 10x easier, we could just write a quick Github workflow and trigger it when a new `git tag` and update the `Package.swift` after the release with the new url + checksum. When we do that everything would look fine on paper the `Package.swift` would have the proper url and checksum and the artifact would be uploaded as Github release. The weird bug that would happen is that the `git tag` created for that release happened before we actually updated our `Package.swift` as we have tagged a previous commit (not the one with the new checksum and url) so when an end-user would then want to use our Swift Package with version `1.0.1` it would actually get the version `1.0.0` (if we follow semver versioning) as for the `git tag` `1.0.1` the `Package.swift` contains the contents of `1.0.0` this is how Swift Package Manager works and we can't circumvent this...

## Step 1: Compiling

We are going to start of by creating an basic compilation script to compile our project and create an XCFramework. We are going to compile a `.framework` for each platform that we support.

The code bellow is for demonstration purposes only:

```bash
FRAMEWORK_NAME="MyFramework"
PLATFORM_LIST=("iOS" "iOS Simulator")

# Create Archives
for platform in "${PLATFORM_LIST[@]}"
do
echo "Archiving platform: $platform"
xcodebuild -verbose archive \
    -workspace "$FRAMEWORK_NAME.xcworkspace" \
    -scheme $FRAMEWORK_NAME \
    -destination "generic/platform=$platform" \
    -archivePath "path/to/archive/$platform" \
done
```

After we have created a standalone `.framework` we need to wrap all the platforms into a single `XCFramework`:

```bash
echo "Creating $FRAMEWORK_NAME XCFramework..."
xcodebuild -create-xcframework \
    -archive $RELEASE_DIR/$ARCHIVE_DIR/iOS.xcarchive -framework $FRAMEWORK_NAME.framework \
    -archive $RELEASE_DIR/$ARCHIVE_DIR/iOS\ Simulator.xcarchive -framework $FRAMEWORK_NAME.framework \
    -output $RELEASE_DIR/$FRAMEWORK_NAME.xcframework
```

## Step 2: Store the XCFramework

Woohooo! We have our product that we can deploy out to the wild but wait ü§î the compiled `MyFramework.xcframework` is located on our private build server and was triggered from our private repo. Our intention to hide the implementation was successful but we need to upload the binary somewhere accessible so that we can actually upload it on our public repo.

For this purpose I have chosen to do the release twice ü´®. Hear me out first. First we already have access to the private git repo from our build server so creating a GitHub release using the `gh` CLI is trivial this way we can also validate the release on our private GitHub release page before it goes out to the users on our public GitHub release page.

But again why would you need to 2 releases, well it's simple again our build server has access to all our repos so we can actually download the compiled binary from the private repo and re-publish it on our public repo.

Here is a demo code that upload our compiled XCFramework and creates an GitHub release using `gh` CLI:

```bash
gh release create $GIT_TAG ./Release/MyFramework -t "v${GIT_TAG}" -F ./Changelog.md
```

We can now download the framework from:

`https://github.com/$ORG/$REPO/releases/download/$GIT_TAG/MyFramework.zip`

## Step 3: Triggering other pipelines

Awesome we have a way for our public build server to fetch the compiled framework and create an release without our beautiful closed-source code to be exposed. Now all that we got to do is to trigger the pipeline on the public build from our private repo.

We are using `CircleCI` as our build server but I am sure that other providers allow you to trigger pipelines using http requests cause that is how we are going to do it.

On our private build server trigger the http request to start the public build server pipeline:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url $PUBLIC_CIRCLE_PROJECT \
  --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLECI_API_KEY" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --data '{"parameters":{"run-release-workflow": true, "version":"'$CIRCLE_TAG'", "changelog":"'$(cat ./ExternalChangelog.md | base64)'"}}'
```

Cool right and we also provided an custom changelog that will go with the public release. This means that we have completely automated and separated our two releases. We are also sending metadata such as the version of the framework which is really important for the public pipeline to know.

## Step 4: Publishing

Now the last part here is when the pipeline on the public build server gets triggered we need to download the framework from our private repo and get the SHA-256.

Downloading the framework

```bash
gh release download --repo $PRIVATE_REPO_URL <<parameters.version>>
```

Calculate the CHECKSUM

```bash
echo "CHECKSUM=$(shasum -a 256 MyFramework.zip | awk '{print $1}')" >> $BASH_ENV
```

Okay we have the repo, we have the checksum we can now modify our `Package.swift` with this data. Our build server treated by GitHub as a regular user that is why it can access repos and download stuff from it if it can do that it can also create commits and push out code.

We are going to run an custom script that will take 2 inputs the version of the framework and CHECKSUM and this script will update our `Package.swift`.

The script can look something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check for arguments
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "No arguments provided. First argument has to be version, e.g. '1.0.0'"
    exit 1
fi

# Assuming this script is executed from directory which contains Package.Swift
# take version (e.g. 1.0.0) as argument
# take checksum as argument
NEW_VERSION=$1
NEW_CHECKSUM=$2

echo "Updating Package.swift..."
echo "üîê New checksum is: $NEW_CHECKSUM"

# Replace version information in package manifest
sed -E -i '' 's/let version = ".+"/let version = "'$NEW_VERSION\"/ Package.swift

# Replace checksum information in package manifest
sed -i -E "s/checksum: \".*\"/checksum: \"$NEW_CHECKSUM\"/" Package.swift

# print out package manifest for convenience reasons
echo "üìú New Package Manifest is:"
cat Package.swift

# delete downloaded zip file
rm Package.swift-E
```

Make sure that `Package.swift` has an top variable called `let version` so that we can modify it simply:

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.6

import PackageDescription

let version = "<VERSION>"

let package = Package(
.
.
  targets: [
    .binaryTarget(
      name: "MyFramework",
      url: "https://github.com/org/repo/releases/download/\(version)/MyFramework.zip",
      checksum: "<CHECKSUM>"
    ),
  ]
.
.
)
```

Code modified so lets create an actual release:

```bash
git config --global user.email "$SRE_EMAIL"
git config --global user.name "CircleCI Bot"
git add git add Package.swift
git commit -m "release: <<parameters.version>> [skip ci]"
git push origin main
```

Now publish the release

```bash
gh release create <<parameters.version>> ./MyFramework.zip -t "v<<parameters.version>>" -F ./CHANGELOG.md
```

## Conclusion

That is all folks. We have successfully created 2 pipelines that both validate our work, update all manifests and publish them when ever we push put a new `git tag`.
