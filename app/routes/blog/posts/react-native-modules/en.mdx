# Linking Dependencies Inside React Native View Modules for iOS

I'll start this blog **post** by saying that I have gained tremendous respect **for** my colleagues who use React Native day in and day out. The sheer number of tools **needed** to run and compile a single React Native project is truly overwhelming.

## Introduction

### The Promise

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) promises to significantly reduce the workload needed to produce a multi-platform app. With just a single JavaScript™️ project, an individual can create both an iOS and Android app that offer consistent behavior and appearance.

### The Reality

When tasked with building custom experiences, like the one my client required, you quickly realize that three integrated development environments (IDEs) must run side-by-side to get the app functioning.

Managing attention across three distinct contexts—iOS, Web, and Android—is already a challenge. But then, you're hit with platform-specific errors. These errors are not only obscure but are further complicated by the lack of robust debugging tools for React Native.

One can only hope that divine intervention, in the form of God, Google, or ChatGPT, might come to the rescue!

### The Problem

We're attempting to construct what's termed as a [React Native Native Component iOS](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-components-ios). This leverages a native Swift™️ [XCFramework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating-a-multi-platform-binary-framework-bundle) named [Wowza Flowplayer Apple SDK](https://github.com/flowplayer/apple-sdk-releases), which I developed.

> The **Wowza Flowplayer Apple SDK** is a fully integrated video player that supports various media types, including VODs and livestreams. Despite its compact size and customizability, it operates seamlessly, demanding minimal device resources thanks to its efficient architecture.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project

Starting a project using the [react-native-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-cli) and manually linking the `Native Module` can quickly become chaotic due to the extensive linking required for your project.

The linkage should ideally resemble:

```
Native Module -> React Native -> Example App
```

If you're contemplating starting from scratch and manually connecting everything, I'd strongly advise against it. Achieving this without deep expertise in all three platforms (Web, iOS, and Android) is nearly an insurmountable challenge.

Instead, I recommend utilizing the [react-native-builder-bob](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-builder-bob) CLI from [Callstack™️](https://callstack.com?utm_source=rashadatjou). This tool is incredibly user-friendly, ensuring you're operational in no time.

To get started, you'll want to follow the documentation and execute:

```bash
» npx create-react-native-library@latest my-library
```

Answer the questions of the CLI:

```bash
? What is the name of the npm package? › <NAME>

? What is the description for the package? › <DESCRIPTION>

? What is the name of package author? › <DEVELOPER>

? What is the email address for the package author? › <EMAIL>

? What is the URL for the package author? › <URL>

? What is the URL for the repository? › <GIT_URL>

? What type of library do you want to develop? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    JavaScript library - supports Expo Go and Web
    Native module
 ❯  Native view
    Turbo module with backward compat
    Turbo module
    Fabric view with backward compat
    Fabric view

? Which languages do you want to use? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    Java & Objective-C
    Kotlin & Objective-C
    Java & Swift
❯   Kotlin & Swift
```

After the questioner the CLI will create your project and you will get the following message:

```bash
✔ Project created successfully at awesome-library!

Get started with the project:

  $ yarn

Run the example app on iOS:

  $ yarn example ios

Run the example app on Android:

  $ yarn example android
```

All that remains is for us to `cd` into our project root and install the staggering number of dependencies required for this behemoth to function.

```bash
» cd my-library
» yarn
```

## Step 2: Setting Up the Project Structure

The project comes bundled with an array of helpful tools. However, in our specific scenario, many of these tools only contribute to software bloat. I will walk you through the project and its structure:

```bash
» ls -a
– .editorconfig
– .git
– .gitattributes
– .github
– .gitignore
– .nvmrc
– .watchmanconfig
– .yarnrc
– android
– babel.config.js
– CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
– CONTRIBUTING.md
– example
– ios
– lefthook.yml
– LICENSE
– node_modules
– package.json
– react-native-awesome-library.podspec
– README.md
– scripts
– src
– tsconfig.build.json
– tsconfig.json
– turbo.json
– yarn.lock
```

As shown above the scaffold project is huge and to make it easier for everyone to follow along we will delete certain files and remove tools that uses them. But first let's explain all the files above and what they do:

**`.editorconfig`** – [editorconfig.org](https://editorconfig.org)

EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs.

**`.git`**

This is a directory where Git stores metadata and object files for the repository. It's the heart of the Git version control system.

**`.gitattributes`**

Configuration file for Git that can define attributes for paths, such as handling line endings or marking paths as export-ignore.

**`.github`** – [github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows)

This directory often contains GitHub-specific configurations, such as workflows for GitHub Actions or templates for issues and pull requests.

**`.gitignore`**

A file that specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore when performing operations.

**`.nvmrc`** – [nvm-sh](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#nvmrc)

Contains a version number that tells nvm (Node Version Manager) which version of Node.js to use for the project.

**`.watchmanconfig`** – [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)

Configuration file for Watchman, a tool by Facebook that watches for file changes.

**`.yarnrc`** – [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

Configuration file for Yarn, a JavaScript package manager. It may contain settings like registry URL or package installation settings.

**`android`**

This directory contains the native code for the Android platform.

**`babel.config.js`** – [babeljs.io](https://babeljs.io/)

Configuration file for Babel, a JavaScript transpiler. It helps convert ES6/ES7 JavaScript code into a version that can run in current JavaScript engines.

**`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`**

Guidelines for how contributors should behave within the community.

**`CONTRIBUTING.md`** [contributing.md](https://contributing.md/)

Guidelines for people who want to contribute to the project.

**`example`**

Example or demo application that uses the library/module being developed.

**`ios`**

This directory contains the native code for the iOS platform.

**`lefthook.yml`** – [evilmartians/lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook)

Configuration file for `Lefthook`, a fast and powerful Git hooks manager.

**`LICENSE`**

Specifies the license for the project. It defines how the software can be used and distributed.

**`node_modules`**

Folder where all the modules and libraries are stored after they're installed via yarn.

**`package.json`**

Contains metadata about the project, like its dependencies, scripts, version, etc.

**`react-native-awesome-library.podspec`**

A specification file for CocoaPods, which is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C. It describes the properties of the native module for iOS.

**`README.md`**

Documentation for the project. It gives an overview of what the project does, how to set it up, and other essential information.

**`scripts`**

Typically contains custom scripts that help in various project operations, like building or deployment.

**`src`**

TypeScript Source code directory of the project.

**`tsconfig.build.json`** – [typescriptlang.org/tsconfig](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig)

TypeScript compiler configuration specific for building the project.

**`tsconfig.json`** – [typescriptlang.org/tsconfig](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig)

Base TypeScript compiler configuration for the project.

**`turbo.json`** – [turbo.build/repo](https://turbo.build/repo)

Configuration for Turbo, which might be related to speeding up builds or other tasks within the project.

**`yarn.lock`**

Automatically generated file by Yarn that locks the installed versions of each package to ensure consistency across environments.

> Okay... so you only need to know 13 different tools/technologies nothing to worry about 😅

## Step 3: Exploring the Code

In this section, we'll delve into the JavaScript™️ and iOS parts of the code. Please note that the Android aspect won't be covered in this tutorial.

### JavaScript

Upon opening the `src` directory, you'll encounter the TypeScript code that we aim to integrate. The structure is fairly straightforward:

```bash
» cd src
» ls -R

– index.tsx
– __tests__/
  – index.test.tsx
```

Now let's look into the `index.tsx` and see what fun things are waiting for us inside:

```bash
» cat index.tsx
```

```javascript
import {
  requireNativeComponent,
  UIManager,
  Platform,
  type ViewStyle,
} from "react-native";

const LINKING_ERROR =
  `The package 'react-native-awesome-library' doesn't seem to be linked. Make sure: \n\n` +
  Platform.select({ ios: "- You have run 'pod install'\n", default: "" }) +
  "- You rebuilt the app after installing the package\n" +
  "- You are not using Expo Go\n";

type AwesomeLibraryProps = {
  color: string,
  style: ViewStyle,
};

const ComponentName = "AwesomeLibraryView";

export const AwesomeLibraryView =
  UIManager.getViewManagerConfig(ComponentName) != null
    ? requireNativeComponent < AwesomeLibraryProps > ComponentName
    : () => {
        throw new Error(LINKING_ERROR);
      };
```

Here's what's happening in the file:

1. **Importing Dependencies:** All essential dependencies from the `react-native` module are being imported.
2. **Linking Error Message:** An error message is established to guide anyone using this module, explaining potential reasons for malfunctions.
3. **Type Declarations:** The `types` our `view` accepts are declared. These properties should align with those exported from the native iOS/Android side.
4. **View Name Declaration:** The name of our `view` is defined, corresponding to the actual native `view` from iOS/Android.
5. **Loading the View:** We attempt to load the actual `view` using `requireNativeComponent`. Once successfully loaded, it's exported to be incorporated within our React Native module.

### iOS

With a grasp on how the JavaScript™️ side functions, let's move on to the iOS side and explore its contents.

```bash
» cd ../
» cd ios/
» ls -R

– AwesomeLibrary-Bridging-Header.h
– AwesomeLibraryViewManager.m
– AwesomeLibrary.xcodeproj/
– AwesomeLibraryViewManager.swift
```

At first glance, it appears to be standard boilerplate code for an `Objective-C` library. Let's delve into the files sequentially and discover what lies within.

**AwesomeLibrary-Bridging-Header.h**

```bash
» cat AwesomeLibrary-Bridging-Header.h
```

```swift
#import <React/RCTViewManager.h>
```

The so-called "Bridging-Header" file acts as an `Objective-C` header, creating a bridge between our `Swift` code and `Objective-C`. This header not only imports the `React/RCTViewManager` but also all other `Objective-C` dependencies. This allows them to be used in our `Swift` files without the need for explicit imports.

**AwesomeLibraryViewManager.m**

```bash
» cat AwesomeLibraryViewManager.m
```

```swift
#import <React/RCTViewManager.h>

@interface RCT_EXTERN_MODULE(AwesomeLibraryViewManager, RCTViewManager)

RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY(color, NSString)

@end
```

We once again import the `RCTViewManager`.

The official React Native documentation provides clarity on the role of `RCTViewManager`:

> Native views are created and manipulated by subclasses of RCTViewManager. These subclasses are similar in function to view controllers, but are essentially singletons - only one instance of each is created by the bridge.

From this, we gather that the `RCTViewManager` acts as the representative of our `view` within our JavaScript code. In this context, we create and simultaneously export `AwesomeLibraryViewManager`, which carries a sole property, `color: NSString`.

**AwesomeLibraryViewManager.swift**

```bash
» cat AwesomeLibraryViewManager.swift
```

```swift
@objc(AwesomeLibraryViewManager)
class AwesomeLibraryViewManager: RCTViewManager {

  override func view() -> (AwesomeLibraryView) {
    return AwesomeLibraryView()
  }

  @objc override static func requiresMainQueueSetup() -> Bool {
    return false
  }
}

class AwesomeLibraryView : UIView {

  @objc var color: String = "" {
    didSet {
      self.backgroundColor = hexStringToUIColor(hexColor: color)
    }
  }

  func hexStringToUIColor(hexColor: String) -> UIColor {
    let stringScanner = Scanner(string: hexColor)

    if(hexColor.hasPrefix("#")) {
      stringScanner.scanLocation = 1
    }
    var color: UInt32 = 0
    stringScanner.scanHexInt32(&color)

    let r = CGFloat(Int(color >> 16) & 0x000000FF)
    let g = CGFloat(Int(color >> 8) & 0x000000FF)
    let b = CGFloat(Int(color) & 0x000000FF)

    return UIColor(red: r / 255.0, green: g / 255.0, blue: b / 255.0, alpha: 1)
  }
}
```

At last, we've stumbled upon the actual implementation of the Native Swift UI. After going through the numerous files, it's a relief to locate the core code.

A crucial point of emphasis here is the utilization of the `@objc` attribute to expose our Swift code to Objective-C. React Native leverages a Static Objective-C Library for the native code. To align with this structure, our `AwesomeLibraryViewManager` must be presented as an Objective-C class. While the `AwesomeLibraryView`, inheriting from the `UIView` class of the `UIKit` (an Objective-C UI framework), doesn't require annotation, the `color: String` instance property must carry the `@objc` annotation for proper exposure to Objective-C.

## Step 4: Adding 3rd party Swift Dependencies

This part proved to be more tricky then it should be due to missing documentation on the React Native site. If we go to the official docs and see how to import 3rd party dependencies we will see [this](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking-libraries-ios). The docs show us that we need to drag and drop our libraries/frameworks into our project and then we are going to be able to actually use them.

In our scenario this is wrong and it should not be done this way! If we want to setup a proper development environment so that we don't need to manage our dependency versions and other knick-knacks we are going to use `CocoaPods` and the already present `.podspec` file that was generated for us.

Let's open the `react-native-awesome-library.podspec` file and see what we have:

```ruby
require "json"

package = JSON.parse(File.read(File.join(__dir__, "package.json")))
folly_compiler_flags = '-DFOLLY_NO_CONFIG -DFOLLY_MOBILE=1 -DFOLLY_USE_LIBCPP=1 -Wno-comma -Wno-shorten-64-to-32'

Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  s.name         = "react-native-awesome-library"
  s.version      = package["version"]
  s.summary      = package["description"]
  s.homepage     = package["homepage"]
  s.license      = package["license"]
  s.authors      = package["author"]

  s.platforms    = { :ios => "11.0" }
  s.source       = { :git => "https://github.com/rashadatjou/react-native-awesome-library.git", :tag => "#{s.version}" }

  s.source_files = "ios/**/*.{h,m,mm,swift}"

  # Use install_modules_dependencies helper to install the dependencies if React Native version >=0.71.0.
  # See https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/febf6b7f33fdb4904669f99d795eba4c0f95d7bf/scripts/cocoapods/new_architecture.rb#L79.
  if respond_to?(:install_modules_dependencies, true)
    install_modules_dependencies(s)
  else
    s.dependency "React-Core"

    # Don't install the dependencies when we run `pod install` in the old architecture.
    if ENV['RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED'] == '1' then
      s.compiler_flags = folly_compiler_flags + " -DRCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1"
      s.pod_target_xcconfig    = {
          "HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS" => "\"$(PODS_ROOT)/boost\"",
          "OTHER_CPLUSPLUSFLAGS" => "-DFOLLY_NO_CONFIG -DFOLLY_MOBILE=1 -DFOLLY_USE_LIBCPP=1",
          "CLANG_CXX_LANGUAGE_STANDARD" => "c++17"
      }
      s.dependency "React-RCTFabric"
      s.dependency "React-Codegen"
      s.dependency "RCT-Folly"
      s.dependency "RCTRequired"
      s.dependency "RCTTypeSafety"
      s.dependency "ReactCommon/turbomodule/core"
    end
  end
end

```

I won't go into detail and explain what each line here does. The one thing that we are going to remember is the `s.dependency` declarations as that is how we are adding `CocoaPods` dependencies to our project.

To add our desired `Wowza Flowplayer SDK` dependency into our project we are going to add the following right before the `if statement`:

```ruby
# Set FlowplayerSDK dependency
s.dependency "FlowplayerSDK", '~> 4.1.0'
s.dependency "GoogleAds-IMA-iOS-SDK", '~> 3.19.1'
```

All goody, now to run the `yarn` again to install these dependencies. I recommend everyone to always run `yarn clean` then `yarn` just to be sure no pesky bugs arise.

```bash
» yarn clean
» yarn
```

Response:

```bash
error Command failed with exit code 1.
```

But why did it fail? The issue stems that we have already setup our dependencies in our `example/ios/` project and we need to now go purge everything there and restart the installation process.

```bash
» cd example/ios/
» la -a
– .xcode.env
– AwesomeLibraryExample
– AwesomeLibraryExample-Bridging-Header.h
– AwesomeLibraryExample.xcodeproj
– AwesomeLibraryExample.xcworkspace
– AwesomeLibraryExampleTests
– build
– File.swift
– Podfile
– Podfile.lock # delete this
– Pods # delete this
```

```bash
» rm -rf Podfile.lock Pods
```

Awesome by deleting these 2 files now when we run `yarn` again we are going to force CocoaPods to install all dependencies again without any errors.

There is one more extra step we need to do before we can install our dependencies. We need to update the minimum development version of our `example` to iOS 14 as our dependencies require that (you can skip this part if your dependency doesn't require iOS 13 or above)

To accomplish this we are going to need to update both the `Podfile` and our Xcode project.

Update `Podfile` from this:

```bash
» cat Podfile

# Resolve react_native_pods.rb with node to allow for hoisting
require Pod::Executable.execute_command('node', ['-p',
  'require.resolve(
    "react-native/scripts/react_native_pods.rb",
    {paths: [process.argv[1]]},
  )', __dir__]).strip

platform :ios, min_ios_version_supported
prepare_react_native_project!

.
.
.
```

To this:

```bash
» cat Podfile

# Resolve react_native_pods.rb with node to allow for hoisting
require Pod::Executable.execute_command('node', ['-p',
  'require.resolve(
    "react-native/scripts/react_native_pods.rb",
    {paths: [process.argv[1]]},
  )', __dir__]).strip

min_ios_versions_supported = ['14.0', min_ios_version_supported]
index_of_max = min_ios_versions_supported.each_with_index.max_by { |number, _| number.to_f }[1]
platform :ios, min_ios_versions_supported[index_of_max]
prepare_react_native_project!

.
.
.
```

Now open your `*.xcworkspace` file and do the following:

![Xcode Image](/assets/blog2xcode.jpeg)

> Voilà we are done 😅 finally we can start install our dependencies...

Now go back to root of our project install the dependencies:

```bash
» cd ../..
» yarn clean
» yarn
```

Output:

```bash
Pod installation complete! There are 64 dependencies from the Podfile and 56 total pods installed.
✨  Done in 18.88s.
```

DONE AND DONE.

## Step 5 using our 3rd party dependency

We can finally do what React Native promised us that we can concentrate on the coding without worrying about the platform specific details 😉.

Let's open our `ios/AwesomeLibraryViewManager.swift` project with Xcode and add our platform specific code:

```swift
import FlowplayerSDK

// Add the code for setup here
```

Note that there is not going to be any intellisense as Xcode at this point doesn't know what is inside of `FlowplayerSDK`. Good luck though anyway 😅. This is due to how Objective-C allows us to link dependencies during run-time so the compiler doesn't care if you add import something that doesn't actually exists.

## Conclusion

We had to do a lot of platform specific tinkering to actually load our dependency in such a manner that we can update at anytime using our CLI and `CocoaPods`. I hope that this blog helps out some poor soul that needs to go trough the same hell as I did because this was not fun at all.

If you are interested in a part 2 of the blog where I actually go and write code instead of setting up the development environment send an email using my portfolio website.
