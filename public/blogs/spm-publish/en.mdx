This guide is going to be a bit more complicated as it is going to deploy a compiled binary framework from a private repository to a public repository using CI/CD.

Here is the scheme of what we are going to do:

![Release Schema](/assets/blog3schema.svg)

As we can see the process doesn't look that complicated except one single tiny thing that we need to do. We need to synchronies 2 repos so when a `git tag` is created from the private repo where the code is located the public repo gets a new github release and updated `Package.swift` file with a fresh checksum and url.

On the private repo a new `git tag` will trigger the code to get tested & compiled into a `XCFramework`. When we have the `XCFramework` we are going to then get its checksum (`SHA256`) and update the public repos `Package.swift` with the checksum but there is an issue here we also need to provide a public url of where the new `XCFramework` has been hosted. To solve this we are going to leverage Github's release and artifacts and upload the `XCFramework` there + we can use this for users that want to download the standalone framework and integrate it manually into there project.

Alright this sounds nice but there is again an even tinier problem here. The problem is that we need to first update the `Package.swift` and create a commit on the public repo which is pushed to the main branch and then we can actual create the release and upload the `XCFramework`. If we do this the other way around which would have been 10x easier, we could just write a quick Github workflow and trigger it when a new `git tag` and update the `Package.swift` after the release with the new url + checksum. When we do that everything would look fine on paper the `Package.swift` would have the proper url and checksum and the artifact would be uploaded as Github release. The weird bug that would happen is that the `git tag` created for that release happened before we actually updated our `Package.swift` as we have tagged a previous commit (not the one with the new checksum and url) so when an end-user would then want to use our Swift Package with version `1.0.1` it would actually get the version `1.0.0` (if we follow semver versioning) as for the `git tag` `1.0.1` the `Package.swift` contains the contents of `1.0.0` this is how Swift Package Manager works and we can't circumvent this...
